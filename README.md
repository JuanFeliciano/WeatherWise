# Weather Forecast Application

## Overview

This project is a weather forecast application built with Angular 15. It fetches real-time weather data from the HG Brasil Weather API and presents it in a user-friendly interface. The application allows users to select different cities to view current weather conditions and forecasts for the next few days. Additionally, it includes a theme toggle feature for switching between light and dark modes.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: The application retrieves up-to-date weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts, from an external API.
- **City Selection**: Users can choose from a predefined list of cities to view specific weather data for their selected location.
- **Weather Forecast**: Displays a 5-day weather forecast with details such as date, weather condition icon, temperature range, and rain probability.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes, with their preference being saved in local storage.

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Weather Data**: The application uses the HG Brasil Weather API to fetch weather data based on the selected city. The data includes current temperature, weather description, and a forecast for the next five days.
2. **City Selection**: Users can select a city from a dropdown list. The selected city is stored in local storage and used to fetch and display relevant weather data.
3. **Displaying Weather Data**: The weather data is displayed in three main components:
   - **Temperature Component**: Shows the current temperature and weather description for the selected city.
   - **Clime Component**: Displays a 5-day forecast with details on date, weather conditions, temperature range, and rain probability.
   - **Header Component**: Contains the application logo and a button to toggle between light and dark themes.
4. **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes. The selected theme is saved in local storage and applied automatically on subsequent visits.
